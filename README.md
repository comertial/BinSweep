## Installation üöÄ

### Automatic Installation _(Recommended)_

1. Download `BinSweep.ps1` and `installBinSweep.ps1`.
2. Open PowerShell as **Administrator**.
3. Navigate to the download folder.
4. Run:
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force
    .\installBinSweep.ps1
    ```
   - The installer copies BinSweep to Program Files, sets up a daily scheduled task (3:00 PM by default), and configures reliability settings.

#### Alternate Method

If needed, use this to install directly:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "path\to\installBinSweep.ps1"
```

#### Custom Installation

Specify install options if desired:
```powershell
.\installBinSweep.ps1 -InstallLocation "C:\Custom\Path" -SourceScript "C:\Path\To\BinSweep.ps1"
```

### Manual Setup

1. Save `BinSweep.ps1` to your chosen folder.
2. Allow PowerShell script execution as needed.
3. In Task Scheduler:
   - Create a new task named **BinSweep**
   - Schedule it for your preferred time (default: daily, 3:00 PM)
   - **Program/script:**  
     `PowerShell.exe`
   - **Add arguments:**
     ```
     -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -File "C:\Path\To\BinSweep.ps1"
     ```
   - (Recommended) Under task properties:
      - ‚úîÔ∏è "Run with highest privileges"
      - (Optional) On failure, retry every 5 minutes, up to 3 attempts
      - ‚úîÔ∏è "Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed"

## Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Path\To\BinSweep.ps1"
```

**Or, to run/verify via Task Scheduler:**
- Open Task Scheduler, select & run **BinSweep**
- Or in PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'BinSweep'
  ```
